# Vibe Coding for Beginners

**Build products using AI - No coding experience required.**

This repository contains everything you need to go from idea to deployed product in hours, not months. Using AI agents to write code for you, you'll learn to build websites, web apps, and digital products by describing what you want in natural language.

---

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is the practice of building software by communicating with AI agents instead of writing code yourself. You describe what you want, and the AI writes the code. It's like having an expert developer who works 24/7 and costs almost nothing.

**Perfect for:**
- Entrepreneurs with product ideas but no coding skills
- Designers who want to bring visions to life
- Anyone who wants to build something but doesn't want to learn programming
